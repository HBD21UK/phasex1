          <p>Another year has gone,</p>
          <p>in the blink of an eye.</p>
          <p><strong>But today is specialâ€¦</strong></p>
          <p>because it's your day.</p>
          <p>I made all this</p>
          <p>as a birthday present for you.</p>

          <p>Thank you for the friendship we share,</p>
          <p>thank you for always being there.</p>
          <p>I wish you nothing but the best.</p>
          <p>May your life be filled with ease,</p>
          <p>may all your dreams come true,</p>
          <p>and may you always fly free</p>
          <p>like a bird in the blue sky.</p>

          <p>Now, a new chapter beginsâ€¦</p>
          <p>the real story of your life is just about to unfold.</p>
          <p>This year will be brighter,</p>
          <p>filled with happiness along the way.</p>
          <p>Keep your spirit high,</p>
          <p>and enjoy every single moment.</p>

          <p>I once wished for a friend like you</p>
          <p>someone I could trust with anything.</p>
          <p>I used to think I'd never trust anyone againâ€¦</p>
          <p>until I met you.</p>
          <p>You are one of the best things that ever happened to me.</p>
          <p>When no one was there for me, you were.</p>
          <p>You have no idea how much I value you.</p>
          <p>Sometimes I wonder if I even deserve a friend like you.</p>

          <p>I really admire the way you look at life</p>
          <p>how optimistic you are,</p>
          <p>no matter how tough things get.</p>
          <p>You always manage to find a reason to smile.</p>
          <p>No matter the situation,</p>
          <p>I know I can always rely on you.</p>

          <p>Sometimes I get pessimistic about life,</p>
          <p>but then I rememberâ€¦</p>
          <p>I have you by my side.</p>
          <p>And I believe everything will eventually work out.</p>
          <p>And even if it doesn't,</p>
          <p>I'd still be grateful for you.</p>

          <p>I know life isn't going exactly how we imagined,</p>
          <p>but no matter what, I'll always stand by your side.</p>
          <p>I wish you all the best this world has to offer.</p>

          <p><strong>Lastlyâ€¦</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Happy Birthday, Shabbo! ðŸŽ‰</strong></p>
